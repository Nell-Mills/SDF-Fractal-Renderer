<Brief introduction to report and report structure>

\section{Project Aim}

Improve the speed of rendering 3D fractals using 3D SDF.

If fail, use temporal caching.

Compare two methods.

\section{Deliverables}

Report, code

\section{Methodology and Version Control}

Version control - GitHub

Methodology - Waterfall, since all Vulkan setup needs doing first

\section{Risks and Mitigation}

Risk that 3D SDF won't work - mitigation is temporal caching
