\section{Project Aim}

Improve the speed of rendering 3D fractals using 3D SDF.

If fail, use temporal caching.

Compare two methods.

No. Improve the speed of rendering 3D fractals using precalculated information. Two ideas, 3D SDF and temporal caching. Idea is to provide clue in place of calculations, to save time and/or iterations. 3D SDF there to reduce calculations in favour of precalculated values, temporal caching there to reduce iterations by skipping some distance.

\section{Deliverables}

Report, code

\section{Methodology and Version Control}

Version control - GitHub

Methodology - Waterfall, Vulkan has to be done first before picture can be rendered, then optimizations have to be done before measurements can be taken.

Show diagram of project stages, no Gantt chart.

\section{Risks and Mitigation}

Risk that 3D SDF won't work - mitigation is temporal caching
