\section{Project Structure and Overview}

Version control - GitHub
Methodology - Waterfall, since all Vulkan setup needs doing first
Show Gantt chart maybe... probably not.
C and Make - JUSTIFY (efficient data structures - arrays, performance, speed, don't badmouth C++, be reasonable).

\section{Rendering 3D Fractals}

Shader implementation of signed distance function for Mandelbulb
View distance limit

\section{3D Signed Distance Field}

Centered around fractal - Mandelbulb
Centered around camera - Hall of Pillars?

\section{Temporal Caching}

Single image - memory of 4 previous frames.
Why did I choose length / 4? Be more scientific about it.
Talk about how you dealt with movement - temporal reprojection?

\section{Performance Measurement}

\subsection{Data Types Collected}

Mention image copying time and how it could be avoided altogether, so didn't measure.
Measured geometry pass time.
Median, min, max, frame time.

\subsection{Representative Views}

Hall of Pillars - Room with archway
Hall of Pillars - Flat ground
Hall of Pillars - Room with huge distance differences and bottlenecks
Hall of Pillars - Room with very short distance to back, maybe bottlenecks

Mandelbulb - Full view, lots of white space
Mandelbulb - Zoomed in so it covers the screen
Mandelbulb - Try to find a view with bottleneck
Mandelbulb - Zoom in to get detail

\subsection{Animation}

Hall of Pillars - Flythrough
Hall of Pillars - Varying parameter?

Mandelbulb - Varying parameter
Mandelbulb - Fly across? Probably not.
