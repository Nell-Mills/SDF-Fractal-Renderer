\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter6}

Things to mention:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ambient occlusion and how reducing the number of iterations ruins it.
\end{itemize}

Further work:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Figure out a way to remove artefacts from movement without resetting distance for everything. Artefact detection.
	\item Find a way to copy the 2D SDF image faster.
	\item Make the 3D SDF move with the camera so that it can handle movement through the scene.
	\item Move the generation of the 3D SDF to the shaders, maybe make it coarser so it can be regenerated every frame (so it can handle animation)?
\end{itemize}

Mention exciting Vulkan extension and how NVIDIA haven't implemented it yet.
