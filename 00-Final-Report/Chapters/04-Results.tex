\section{3D SDF}

\subsection{Mandelbulb}

Remark on results for different SDF levels (1 - 9).

\subsection{Hall of Pillars}

Remark on results for different SDF levels (1 - 9).

\section{Temporal Caching}

\subsection{Mandelbulb}

\subsection{Hall of Pillars}

Show four images, displaying iterations with fog:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Top-Left: No SDF, no movement.
	\item Bottom-Left: No SDF, movement.
	\item Top-Right: Temporal Caching, no movement.
	\item Bottom-Right: Temporal Caching, movement.
\end{itemize}

Show two graphs for animations. Show one for raw measurements, and then show one for percentage difference. Have y = 0 as a line in the middle so positive or negative performance differences can be seen.\newline

For static images, show a table for each relevant separate set of measurements.
