\section{Algorithms}

The implemention for the distance estimator for the Mandelbulb fractal was influenced by the content in these two sites:\newline

https://iquilezles.org/articles/mandelbulb/\newline
http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/09/distance-estimated-3d-fractals-v-the-mandelbulb-different-de-approximations/\newline

The formula for the Hall of Pillars fractal was obtained from:\newline

https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s3GW2\newline

The algorithm for calculating the intersection point of a ray with a cube was obtained from:\newline

https://iquilezles.org/articles/intersectors/

\chapter{Ethical Issues Addressed}
