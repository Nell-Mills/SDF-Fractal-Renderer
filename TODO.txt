Coding:

Finish handle printing function		-->

Choose representative views		-->
Gather performance measurements		-->

Get measurements for multi-mandelbulb	-->

Go back to SDF around Mandelbulb + hybrid approach where you search through SDF until the cube
index stops changing, then go to normal distance measurement. This is probably the best approach.
Don't have the ray culling step, but do have the step with the ray-cube intersection and march.

Coding if time:

See if performance differences vary with resolution (apart from scaling proportionally).

Get rid of image copy - instead, swap G-Buffer image and texture image every frame.

Maybe try implementing sparse octree again.
