Coding:

Finish handle printing function		-->

Set up flythrough animation (just one)	--> Almost done.

Choose representative views		-->
Performance measurements		--> Got method, need data.
Set up measurements for flythrough	-->
Investigate why warm up isn't working	--> Wrong, it is working.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coding if time:

See if performance differences vary with resolution (apart from scaling proportionally).

3D SDF moving with camera.
3D SDF around Mandelbulb - do culling optimizations for main cube in ALL shaders.
About above, do a single sample, also try getting as close to the surface as possible, then
moving on to the regular distance function.

Get rid of image copy - instead, swap G-Buffer image and texture image every frame.

Maybe try implementing sparse octree again.
