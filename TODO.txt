Coding:

Finish handle printing function		-->

Get rid of image copy measurement	-->

Colour different fractals		--> Done.

Do different SDFunc for 3D SDF		--> Done.

Set up flythrough animation (just one)	--> Done.

Choose representative views		-->
Performance measurements		--> Got method, need data.
Set up measurements for flythrough	-->
Investigate why warm up isn't working	-->

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coding if time:

3D SDF moving with camera.
3D SDF around Mandelbulb - do culling optimizations for main cube in ALL shaders.
About above, do a single sample, also try getting as close to the surface as possible, then
moving on to the regular distance function.

Get rid of image copy - instead, swap G-Buffer image and texture image every frame.

Maybe try implementing sparse octree again.
